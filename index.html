			<div class="body">
				<p> Should I complete the daily health form Beaver asks me to do everyday? It could be easier for me to just skip it. </p>
				<img src="/images/d0.JPG" alt="Graphic">
				<p> I completed the health form. Completing the health form is the deontologically ethical decision, since to not fill it out or to rush through it without paying attention would be dishonest and could put others in harms way.</p>

				<h2><span class="small">   </span> Dilemma Two </h2>
			</div>
			<div class="body">
				<p>Do I join my meeting during the car ride to school? If I do, I will not be keeping my Mom company on the drive in, but if I don’t, I will be shirking my responsibilities.</p>
				<img src="http://placehold.it/1000x500" alt="Graphic">
				<p>I joined the meeting. Under my deontological rules, I should have joined it, since to not show up to the meeting would be breaking my word and would not be kind to the people expecting me to be there.</p>

				<h2><span class="small">   </span> Dilemma Three </h2>
			</div>
			<div class="body">
				<p>Do I do my English work in English class? I could either do other work or not work at all? Mr. Eaton did ask us to work on our projects, but I could not listen to him.</p>
				<img src="/images/d2.JPG" alt="Graphic">
				<p> I did my English work. To do my English work would be the most deontologically ethical decision. Since Mr. Eaton asked us to do our English work, it would be dishonest to not do it and would be acting out of self-interest. </p>

				<h2><span class="small">   </span> Dilemma Four</h2>
			</div>
			<div class="body">
				<p>Do I leave the Zoom meeting if there’s no time left so I can go do my work or do I stay on, even if it means I can’t do my homework?</p>
				<img src="/images/d3.JPG" alt="Graphic">
				<p> I left the meeting. To stay in the meeting. Leaving the meeting wouldn’t be ethical since my reasoning is in self-interest. Ending the meeting would be putting my wants above the other people’s wants. </p>

				<h2><span class="small">   </span> Dilemma Five</h2>
			</div>
			<div class="body">
				<p> Should I always have my mask on when inside? I could just take it off, especially when over 6 feet away from others since its not comfortable. </p>
				<img src="http://placehold.it/1000x500" alt="Graphic">
				<p> I kept my mask on. Keeping my mask on is the correct decision according to my rules, since taking it off inside at all could harm others, isn’t keeping my word to the school’s COVID honor code, and it would be acting out of self-interest. </p>

			<div class="body">
				<p> When working in math class, should I work on the math homework I have for Thursday or should I work on the homework due tomorrow? </p>
				<img src="/images/d5.JPG" alt="Graphic">
				<p> I worked on tomorrow’s homework. Working on my math homework would be the ethical choice, since, like the earlier English class, I was asked to work on math. I acted out of self-interest since I prioritized my own work. </p>

			</div>
			<div class="body">
				<p>When walking my dog, should I pick up after him when he poops? It’s kind of gross and there’s no one around, so no one would know I left the poop.</p>
				<img src="http://placehold.it/1000x500" alt="Graphic">
				<p>I cleaned up after my dog. Leaving the poop is not ethical according to deontology since it would be acting out of self-interest. Cleaning up after my dog is also being kind, since it’s not making my neighborhood dirtier.</p>
